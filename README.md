# Age Of Empires 3 DE: Mod Manager

This program is a basic mod manager for Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition. It allows you to install and manage your installed mods from outside of the game, without the need to restart. This application requires Java 8 to be installed on your computer at the minimum and works on Linux and Windows (MacOS is not a supported platform currently). I have provided dummy files to create and test out the mod manager in action

<b>Installation:</b>

<b><i>AUTOMATED:</i></b> 

Download the "Installer.jar" file (this is an executable java archive).  Double
click to run it. Left click on the menu button to see all 4 options. Be sure to
view the readme first. Click "Install Mod" to copy over files, and if you're
done, click "Remove Mod" to go back to RE.

NOTE: The Installer requires an updated version of Java on your system to work.
This program was built with OpenJDK 16, but requires Java 8 at the minimum. If
you don't have Java installed, go to oracle.com/java or use your system package
manager on Linux. 

NOTE 2: This Installer currently only supports default Steam installations on
Linux and Windows. If you're using a non-standard install, the Microsoft
Store/Game Pass, you need to do the manual method in the meantime.

<b><i>MANUAL:</i></b>

Copy the mod directory to your Age of Empires 3 DE's mods directory to
install the mod.


Linux: this should be $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/933110/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Games/Age of Empires 3 DE/(16 Digit Unique Numeric ID)/mods/local

Windows: %USERPROFILE%\Games\Age of Empires 3 DE\ (16 Digit Unique Numeric ID)\mods\local
